### **Concurrency Design Patterns**  
These patterns focus on managing concurrency and multi-threading in software systems.

1. **Active Object**  
2. **Thread Pool**

4. **Mutex**  
5. **Semaphore**  
6. **Monitor Object**  
7. **Guarded Suspension**  
8. **Wait-Notify**  
9. **Producer-Consumer**  
10. **Future**  
11. **Balking**  
12. **Schedulable Task**  
13. **Guarded Suspension**  

---

### **Architectural Design Patterns**  
These patterns address the structure of the system as a whole, focusing on the high-level design.

1. **Layered Architecture (n-tier)**  
2. **Client-Server**  
3. **Microservices**  
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**  
5. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**  
6. **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**  
7. **Model-View-Presenter (MVP)**  
8. **Pipeline**  
9. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**  
10. **Component-Based Architecture**  
11. **RESTful Architecture**  
12. **Event-Sourcing**  
13. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
14. **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**  
15. **Publish-Subscribe**  
16. **Broker**  

---

### **Object Behavioral Design Patterns**  
These patterns focus on the behavior of objects and how they interact, beyond just communication.

1. **State Machine**  
2. **Strategy**  
3. **Observer**  
4. **Command**  
5. **Chain of Responsibility**  
6. **Flyweight**  
7. **Prototype**  
8. **Visitor**  
9. **Template Method**  
10. **Memento**  
11. **Null Object**  
12. **Composite**  
13. **Intermediary**  
14. **Abstract Interpreter**  

---

### **Other Notable Patterns**  
These patterns are often used for very specific purposes but are valuable in certain contexts.

1. **Composite**  
2. **Singleton**  
3. **Dependency Injection**  
4. **Strategy Pattern**  
5. **Factory Method Pattern**  
6. **Bridge Pattern**  
7. **Composite Pattern**  
8. **Observer Pattern**  
9. **Flyweight Pattern**  
10. **Abstract Factory Pattern**  
11. **Decorator Pattern**  
12. **Adapter Pattern**  

---

### **Special Patterns**

1. **Double-Checked Locking**  
   Improves performance when accessing shared resources in multi-threaded environments by reducing the overhead of synchronization.

2. **Lazy Loading**  
   Defer the initialization of an object or resource until it's actually needed.

3. **Event-Sourcing**  
   Ensures that changes to application state are stored as a sequence of events rather than the current state, allowing complete reconstruction of state.

4. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**  
   Separates the handling of reading and writing data to increase performance and scalability.

5. **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**  
   A design pattern that facilitates easier unit testing, separation of concerns, and supports data-binding between views and models.

6. **Dependency Injection**  
   Inverts control and makes objects more testable by decoupling object creation and providing them from external sources.

---

### **Anti-Patterns** (Patterns of things that don't work well)

1. **God Object**  
   A class that knows too much or does too much, often leading to maintenance problems.

2. **Spaghetti Code**  
   A term for code with a complex and tangled control structure, often due to excessive coupling and lack of modularity.

3. **Golden Hammer**  
   The tendency to use the same solution for all problems, even if it's not the best fit.

4. **Cut-and-Paste Programming**  
   The practice of copying code to multiple places instead of refactoring and reusing it, leading to code duplication.

5. **Rigidity**  
   The difficulty in making changes to the system due to tight coupling and high dependencies between components.

---

### **Others**

- **Data Transfer Object (DTO)**  
   A simple object that is used to transfer data between different parts of the system, typically between layers or across networks.

- **Proxy Pattern**  
   Acts as an intermediary for another object, enabling additional functionality like lazy initialization, access control, logging, etc.

- **Decorator**  
   Allows for dynamically adding new behavior to objects without altering their structure.

This comprehensive list covers **all the significant software design patterns** that can be found across different domains. Exploring these patterns in-depth will give you a robust understanding of software architecture, design principles, and object-oriented programming. As you work with each pattern, you’ll get a deeper sense of how to apply them effectively and identify which ones best fit specific use cases in your projects.

Good luck with your exploration and learning!
